# Square Numbers Generator

## Description
This simple Python script takes a non-negative integer as input and generates the squares of numbers from 0 to n-1, where n is the input integer. If the input integer is not in the range [0, 20], an error message is displayed.

## How to Use
1. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   python square_numbers_generator.py
   ```
   Replace `square_numbers_generator.py` with the actual filename if different.

2. Enter a non-negative integer when prompted.

3. If the entered integer is in the range [0, 20], the script will print the squares of numbers from 0 to n-1. Otherwise, it will display an error message.
